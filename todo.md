UL website

One page site - wordpress headless cms
some ideas:
http://festival.weareplanc.org/

Sections

- top level navigation (about - whats on - location - get involved)
- big full width Hero image (link read the call out) carousel slides
  (title: Our Right to the City - Festival of Urban Liberation)
- whats on section (these will be individual custom posts as we would want time / location added to them)
- Location (embedded google map)
- Get involved (web form â€” possibly link to airtable)

- Figma template

- Design colours etc.

  - We are still working on the artwork for the leaflets / social media but these are the basic areas of the site.

- use tailwindcss animate plugin

Done:

- Bootstrapped with Vite, React and Tailwind CSS
- I noticed my tailwind class sorting plugin for prettier wasn't working, so I loooked online and found a tutorial that reccommending using .prettierrc.json instead of.prettierrc, which fixed it.
