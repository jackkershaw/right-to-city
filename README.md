# right-to-city

##Â How I made this site:

- Made an Are.na folder of some sites I like:
  https://www.are.na/jack-kershaw/right-to-city
- Started wireframing in Figma
- Bootstrapped with Vite, React and Tailwind CSS
- I noticed my tailwind class sorting plugin for prettier wasn't working, so I loooked online and found a tutorial that reccommending using .prettierrc.json instead of.prettierrc, which fixed it.

## How to run it:

- npm install
- npm run dev
